      <p className='font-vista-sans'>
        The subject of Intellectual Property (IP) rights has been an interesting
        and evolving topic in the Non-fungible Token (NFT) space. Froggy Friends
        has reviewed numerous currently utilized intellectual property documents
        and standards in the respective copyright and intellectual fields and will give
        credit to and cite industry leaders where applicable. Pudgy Penguins and
        World of Women (WOW) are by far the current industry leader in IP
        rights. Pudgy Penguins governing law body currently is documented under
        the State of Delaware, while WOW is governed in accordance with the laws
        of France. Froggy Friends IP is currently primarily governed under the State
        of California law. For the foreseeable future, we will try to adhere to the
        gold standard set forth by Pudgy Penguins and WOW on IP right. This is
        important so that Froggy Friends can evolve with the rapidly changing new
        technology as legal precedence and definitions potentially change current
        understanding of intellectual property rights in accordance with U.S. law.
        At the core, even though NFT technology is relatively new, the IP laws
        governing this new field are not. Basic definitions, along with cited
        materials and legal documents will be given below to help the reader
        understand certain common legal terms.

      <p className='self-start pt-8'>1. DEFINITIONS</p>
      <p className='font-vista-sans py-2'>
        <strong className='font-hwt-artz'>“INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) LAW” </strong>IS A SET OF
        EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO EXCLUDE OTHERS FROM MAKING,
        COPYING, OR USING CERTAIN INTANGIBLE CREATIONS OF THE
        HUMAN MIND. THE U.S. CONSTITUTION PROVIDES CONGRESS
        WITH TWO POWERS RELEVANT TO IP RIGHTS. FIRST, THE IP
        CLAUSE EMPOWERS CONGRESS TO GRANT “AUTHORS AND
        INVENTORS THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO THEIR RESPECTIVE
        WRITINGS AND DISCOVERIES” IN ORDER TO “PROMOTE THE
        PROGRESS OF SCIENCE AND USEFUL ARTS.” SECOND, THE
        COMMERCE CLAUSE ALLOWS CONGRESS TO REGULATE
        INTERSTATE AND FOREIGN COMMERCE. GENERALLY, IP
        RIGHTS ARE INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATION AND THE
        SPREAD OF KNOWLEDGE BY PROVIDING INCENTIVES TO
        CREATE NEW WORKS AND GENERATE USEFUL INVENTIONS. IP
        LAW MAY ALSO SERVE OTHER PURPOSES, SUCH AS PROMOTING
        FAIR COMPETITION, PREVENTING CONSUMER CONFUSION, OR
        DETERRING ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE.”
